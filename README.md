## Introduction:

__This project involves creating a website for a company that designs logos, posters, personal cards, and more. We follow specific guidelines and standards outlined by the ALX software engineering program. This enriching experience has allowed us to gain valuable skills in completing tasks and solving problems effectively and impressively. For team members, I worked with myself. This project was created to facilitate for customers As an engineering problem, I wanted to focus on 2 things: Design and Code.__

__It has been a long time since I have been in the field of programming, a period of more than ten years, where I worked in a field other than my specialization and found myself a mile away from my field, which I was proud of and wished to complete my journey in. Until I found this wonderful opportunity to learn the basics of programming from scratch to professionalism through a video by one of the YouTubers. The important thing is that the journey was delightful because I found what I was looking for and was able to connect the missing threads and return to this more enjoyable and wonderful field. Until I completed my project and chose to design a website dedicated to displaying design services and others creatively and professionally. Of course, I had to choose one of the fields or one of the topics to work on as a solution to a problem. Since I had previously started establishing my project in infographics, I decided to be my first client and make that project the title of my project on the web. Thus I can solve the problems of multiple projects in the future.__

__The architecture of this project will be developed recently, now I just use the application's frontend, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is what the users interact with directly.__

__Three features are completed in the recent project:__
**1- An overview of three important sections of the project which the customer can view clearly.**
**2- Deferent sections can be consulted for the header of the project to allow to visiter to look at details.**
**3- Another section that gives more information about the project and its important links.**

__The first time and because I was so late, I used an external service Wix to develop my website for free. Nevertheless, I decide to work with code to give the project challenges. So I start from the beginning.__

__This project taught me the importance of perseverance and problem-solving. Working through these issues helped me build confidence in my abilities.__

__I am currently focused on self-improvement and skill development, particularly in programming.__
